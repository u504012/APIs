# Design Guidelines
## Introduction

<#name#> is a collection of reusable services that encapsulate well-defined business capabilities. Developers are encouraged to access these capabilities through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that enable consistent design patterns and principles. This facilitates a great developer experience and the ability to quickly compose complex business processes by combining multiple, complementary capabilities as building blocks.

PayPal APIs follow the RESTful architectural style as much as possible. To support our objectives, we have developed a set of rules, standards, and conventions that apply to the design of RESTful APIs. 

The documentation is as generic as possible to make it easier to incorporate into the guidelines you use in your projects.
